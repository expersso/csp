Introduction
------------

This package contains the [Correlates of State Policy](http://http://ippsr.msu.edu/public-policy/correlates-state-policy) dataset, which

> ... includes more than seven-hundred variables, with observations across the U.S. 50 &gt; states and time (1900 â€“ 2016). These variables represent policy outputs or &gt; political, social, or economic factors that may influence policy differences &gt; across the states. The codebook includes the variable name, a short description &gt; of the variable, the variable time frame, a longer description of the variable, &gt; and the variable source(s) and notes.

The package allows the user to load and work with the dataset using the R programming language.
